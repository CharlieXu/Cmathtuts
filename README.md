# Cmathtuts
trying to collect all useful tutorials/examples for famous C math and algebra libraries such as BLAS, CBLAS, LAPACK, LAPACKE, CLAPACK, ATLAS, GSL...
I want to make sure if you are a C developer you can use any of these libraries without any problems regardless of your platform or hardware



issues:

1. I really do not understand the difference between LAPACK, LAPACKE and CLAPACK there might be some confusion in the tutorials
2. not able to compile ATLAS on mac OS X. a bug report was made on sourceforce: https://sourceforge.net/p/math-atlas/bugs/261/
3. need to modify the mitchr make file for CBLAS examples


to do:

1. make compiling/installation for all libraries for different platforms
2. check the Makefile s on other platforms(tested only on mac OS X)


sources to be studied:

1. http://physics.oregonstate.edu/~landaur/nacphy/lapack/cprogp.html
2. https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/c_src/clapack/clapack.html
