# Cmathtuts
trying to collect all useful tutorials for famous C math and algebra libraries such as BLAS, CBLAS, LAPACK, LAPACKE, CLAPACK, ATLAS, GSL...



issues:
1. I really do not understand the difference between LAPACK, LAPACKE and CLAPACK there might be some confusion in the tutorials
2. not able to compile ATLAS on mac OS X. a bug report was made on sourceforce: https://sourceforge.net/p/math-atlas/bugs/261/
