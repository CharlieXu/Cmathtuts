# Cmathtuts
trying to collect all useful tutorials/examples for famous C math and algebra libraries such as BLAS, CBLAS, LAPACK, LAPACKE, CLAPACK, ATLAS, GSL...
I want to make sure if you are a C developer you can use any of these libraries without any problems regardless of your platform or hardware



issues:

1. I really do not understand the difference between LAPACK, LAPACKE and CLAPACK there might be some confusion in the tutorials
2. not able to compile ATLAS on mac OS X. a bug report was made on sourceforce: https://sourceforge.net/p/math-atlas/bugs/261/
3. for some of the BLAS and CBLAS examples the -lgfortran is requred to compile. I don't know why! (on mac OS X you need to install gfortran and then look for libgfortran.dylib and link against it while compiling)


to do:

1. make compiling/installation for all libraries for different platforms
2. check the Makefile s on other platforms(tested only on mac OS X)
